        <h2>Leisure</h2>

<h3>Living in Germany</h3>
<p><strong>Settling</strong><br>It can be difficult to move to a new country and leave all your friends and family behind. Here are some useful tips to help you settle in quickly in Germany!</p>

<p><strong>Leisure</strong><br>Do you like to play football, or would you like to try your hand at a new sport? Germany has a strong club culture. You are free to join any sports club and meet new people. Check out the clubs in your area – either in person or online – or just ask your new colleagues.</p>

<p>Those who prefer mental to physical exercise can take a course at an adult education centre. You can take courses on a wide range of topics at one of over 800 locations across Germany. Adult education centres also offer language courses – you may meet other skilled workers from abroad who are in a similar situation and are also looking for contacts in Germany. Those with a creative streak can take art classes or join a drama group or choir.</p>

<h3>Recreation in Germany</h3>
<p>It is entirely up to you to decide how to spend your free time in Germany. Whether you fancy hiking through German forests, relaxing in the park, swimming in the lake, cycling or perhaps taking short trips to other German cities: Germany has a lot to offer! Visit “Germany Travel” to discover some exciting destinations.</p>

<p>Plenty of options also exist for those who prefer indoor activities. There are more than 6,800 museums across Germany, with exhibitions on technology, history and art, to name but a few. Good to know: many museums host Museum Days or the Long Night of Museums, when admission is reduced or even free. Visiting cultural institutions such as cinemas, theatres and opera houses is also very popular in Germany; they can be found in both large and small cities.</p>

<p>Information about special local events, such as guided tours, street festivals or concerts, is also available online in many cities. In addition, there are often weekend flea markets where people sell second-hand clothes, furniture, bicycles, games and other items for little money.</p>

<h3>Dining</h3>
<p>Germany offers a wide range of dining options in the big cities, as well as in rural areas. In a Brauhaus, you can try typical German dishes such as spaetzle, potato pancakes or escalope. International cuisine is also very popular in Germany, enabling you to either find dishes from your home country or try something new. Major cities also offer a wide range of vegetarian restaurants and fusion cuisine.</p>

<p>Bakeries in Germany are also a popular alternative for a lunchtime snack or a quick bite to go. They offer both sweet (e.g. doughnuts, cakes, croissants) and savoury options (e.g. filled rolls, bacon sticks). The bakeries also have a wide range of breads and rolls to choose from.</p>

<h3>Advisory Services</h3>

<h2>Useful Everyday Knowledge</h2>
<p>Many things are different in Germany, such as opening hours of stores, waste separation, or the purchase of a SIM card. Here you will find answers to the most important questions about everyday life in Germany.</p>

<h3>What public holidays are there in Germany?</h3>
<p>In Germany, public holidays are determined by the federal states. The only exception is the national holiday on 3 October – the Day of German Unity – which is set by federal law and applies throughout Germany. There are also several public holidays declared by all federal states, including New Year’s Day, Easter, and Christmas. Most public holidays have a religious background, especially at Christmas and Easter, when peace and quiet are expected. Shops remain closed on these days, so many German families use public holidays for relaxation or trips.</p>

<h3>The climate in Germany</h3>
<p>Germany has a temperate climate with continental influences, leading to distinct seasons with varying temperatures. Northern Germany, particularly the coastal regions, experiences cooler, harsher weather, often marked by wind and rain. Southern Germany, home to forests and mountains, has an alpine climate in some areas. Despite its geographical location, Germany enjoys a relatively warm climate due to the Gulf Stream, with summer temperatures often exceeding 30°C.</p>

<h3>What plugs and sockets are used in Germany?</h3>
<p>Germany uses Type F and Type C plugs, with Type C plugs commonly known as Europlugs. These are compatible with most European sockets. The voltage in Germany ranges from 220-250 volts. Schuko Type F plugs are typically used for larger electrical appliances like washing machines, while smaller appliances may use contour plugs or Europlugs.</p>

<h3>What are the shop opening hours in Germany?</h3>
<p>Shops in Germany are generally closed on Sundays and public holidays. Large supermarkets are typically open from 7 am to 8 pm, though hours may vary in rural areas. Some smaller shops may close earlier on Saturdays. Pharmacies and certain shops like those at petrol stations or railway stations may remain open on Sundays. It’s always a good idea to check before heading out.</p>

<h3>What are the emergency numbers in Germany?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>110:</strong> Emergency number for the police. Call for police assistance in case of criminal offenses or safety concerns.</li>
    <li><strong>112:</strong> Emergency number for the fire brigade and emergency medical services. Call this for fire or severe medical emergencies.</li>
    <li><strong>116117:</strong> Non-emergency medical on-call service. Use this for medical issues that are not life-threatening, such as needing advice after doctor’s hours.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can I buy a SIM card?</h3>
<p>SIM cards can be purchased at supermarkets, discount stores, mobile phone provider shops, kiosks, and petrol stations in Germany. To activate a SIM card, you’ll need proof of identity. If you don’t have German documents like a residence permit, you might face difficulties and should contact the consumer advice center for assistance.</p>

<h3>What do I need to consider when taking out a mobile phone contract in Germany?</h3>
<p>To sign a mobile phone contract, you need a valid identity card or passport, bank details, and proof of residence. Some providers also require a Schufa report (a credit report). Most contracts are for 24 months, and some include a mobile phone. Compare prices and offers online before signing a contract. Alternatively, you can opt for a prepaid mobile phone if you don’t want a long-term contract.</p>

<h3>How does the postal system work in Germany?</h3>
<p>Germany’s postal system is fast and affordable. Post offices are open until the evening on weekdays and close at noon on Saturdays. You can send letters and parcels via the post office or use automated Packstations available at various locations. These unmanned stations are open 24/7, allowing you to send or pick up parcels at your convenience. Parcels ordered online can be sent directly to a Packstation for easy pickup. Standard delivery times within Germany are typically within three working days.</p>
