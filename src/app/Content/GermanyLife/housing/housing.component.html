    <h2>Driving Licence & Car in Germany: Essential Information</h2>

<h3>Driving Licence Validity</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If your driving licence was issued in the <strong>EU, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Iceland</strong>, it is valid in Germany without any modifications.</li>
    <li>If your licence is from another country, you can drive in Germany for up to <strong>six months</strong> after registering your residence. You will also need an official <strong>German translation</strong> of your driving licence.</li>
    <li>After six months, you will need to exchange your foreign licence for a <strong>German driving licence</strong>. Depending on the country where it was issued, you may or may not need to take a driving test.</li>
    <li>You will also need a <strong>valid eye test</strong> and proof of participation in a <strong>first aid course</strong> to obtain a German licence.</li>
    <li>To apply for a German driving licence, you need to go to the local <strong>Fahrerlaubnisbehörde</strong> (Driving Licence Authority).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Obtaining a German Driving Licence</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To get a German driving licence, you must attend a driving school, pass a <strong>theoretical</strong> and <strong>practical</strong> test.</li>
    <li>Fees for obtaining the licence vary based on the number of lessons and the success of your test attempts. A set number of lessons is compulsory.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Car Ownership and Registration</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Your car must be registered at a <strong>Motor Vehicle Registration Office</strong> (Kraftfahrzeug-Zulassungsbehörde). You will need your <strong>vehicle registration document</strong> (Fahrzeugschein) and proof of insurance.</li>
    <li>If you’re bringing your car from abroad, you must check with the Registration Office to see if any additional documents are required.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Car Inspection (HU)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Every car in Germany must undergo a <strong>general inspection</strong> (Hauptuntersuchung – HU) every <strong>two years</strong>. This inspection ensures your car's <strong>roadworthiness</strong> and its <strong>exhaust emissions</strong>.</li>
    <li>A sticker is placed on your number plate, indicating when the next inspection is due.</li>
    <li>If your vehicle has defects, the inspector will not issue a new sticker until the necessary repairs are made.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Motor vehicle liability insurance</strong> is mandatory for all cars in Germany. It covers damages to other people and vehicles in case of an accident but does not cover damages to your own car.</li>
    <li><strong>Fully comprehensive insurance</strong> is an option if you want coverage for damages to your own vehicle.</li>
    <li><strong>Accident and breakdown cover</strong> includes services such as towing and a hire car if you are involved in an accident or breakdown.</li>
    <li>Joining an <strong>automobile association</strong> may provide additional benefits, especially if you drive often.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Motor Vehicle Tax (Kfz-Steuer)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Car owners in Germany are required to pay a <strong>motor vehicle tax</strong>. Registration for the tax happens at the time of vehicle registration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Important Rules When Driving in Germany</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Driving Direction:</strong> Driving is on the <strong>right-hand side</strong> of the road.</li>
    <li><strong>Seat Belts:</strong> It is mandatory to wear seat belts at all times.</li>
    <li><strong>Winter Tyres:</strong> For driving in winter, <strong>winter tyres</strong> are compulsory when conditions require them.</li>
    <li><strong>Child Seats:</strong> Children must use appropriate <strong>child seats</strong> based on their age and size.</li>
    <li><strong>Documents to Carry:</strong> Always have your <strong>driving licence</strong>, <strong>vehicle registration document</strong>, and <strong>identity card</strong> with you.</li>
    <li><strong>Accident Procedures:</strong> If you are involved in a car accident, call <strong>110</strong> (police emergency number).</li>
    <li><strong>Alcohol Limits:</strong> There are strict <strong>alcohol limits</strong> for drivers. The legal blood alcohol limit is <strong>0.05%</strong>, but <strong>0.00%</strong> is the limit for new drivers, bus drivers, and professional drivers.</li>
    <li><strong>Penalty Points:</strong> Serious traffic violations are recorded in the <strong>Register of Driver Fitness</strong> (Flensburg points system). Accumulating <strong>eight points</strong> may result in the revocation of your driving licence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Low Emission Zones</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Many German cities have <strong>low emission zones</strong> to improve air quality. To drive in these zones, your vehicle must have an <strong>emission control sticker</strong> attached to the windscreen. You can get this sticker at the Registration Office, inspection organizations (such as <strong>DEKRA</strong> or <strong>TÜV</strong>), or authorised repair shops.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mobility in Germany</h2>

<h3>Bicycles and Electric Scooters</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cycling</strong> is a quick and cheap alternative for getting around, both in rural and urban areas. You can buy second-hand bicycles at specialist bike flea markets.</li>
    <li>Many large cities offer <strong>rental bikes</strong>, which you can rent long-term (via subscription) and receive services like repairs.</li>
    <li>If you cycle only occasionally, you can use bike-sharing services and find the nearest bike in your area via an app.</li>
    <li><strong>Electric scooters</strong> have become increasingly popular in recent years and are also available via apps.</li>
    <li><strong>Note:</strong> Bicycles and electric scooters must always be ridden on <strong>cycle paths</strong> or <strong>lanes</strong>, not on footpaths. If no cycle path is available, use the road.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Buses and Trains</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You don’t necessarily need a car in Germany. <strong>Public transport</strong> such as buses, metros, suburban trains, trams, regional trains (RE or RB), long-distance trains (ICE and IC), and long-distance coaches can help you get around.</li>
    <li>Germany has a <strong>well-developed public transport infrastructure</strong>, particularly in urban areas, making it easy to get from one place to another.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Much Does It Cost to Use Buses and Trains?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The cost of public transport depends on the <strong>region</strong> and the <strong>route</strong> you take. Each region has its own transport association that sets the prices.</li>
    <li>You can check transport prices and timetables on the transport association’s website, where many also offer free apps for easy access to schedules and ticket purchases.</li>
    <li>If you use public transport frequently, it’s often cost-effective to purchase a <strong>season ticket</strong> or <strong>monthly pass</strong>, allowing you unlimited travel for a fixed price.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tip: Deutschland-Ticket</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>Deutschland-Ticket</strong> was launched on 1 May 2023. It offers unlimited travel throughout Germany on all <strong>local public transport</strong> (buses, metros, regional trains, etc.).</li>
    <li>This ticket is available only as a monthly cancellable subscription, and costs <strong>€49</strong> per month.</li>
    <li>However, it is not valid on <strong>long-distance trains</strong> (IC, ICE).</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Longer Journeys</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For longer journeys, <strong>long-distance coaches</strong> and trains are also available. It's recommended to compare prices and look for <strong>early-bird offers</strong> since discounted "Sparpreis" fares are often limited.</li>
    <li>For timetables and fares, consult the relevant transport providers.</li>
